# XAI-Based Ransomware Detection: A New Breakthrough in Machine Learning
Our project, “XAI-Based Ransomware Detection: A New Breakthrough in Machine Learning,” addresses these challenges by integrating machine learning with explainable AI (XAI). The system not only improves detection accuracy but also explains the specific behaviors and characteristics that classify a file as ransomware, making the process more transparent and trustworthy. This combination empowers users to better understand, respond to, and prevent ransomware threats.

# 🚀 Demo Instructions

Follow the steps below to run and test the web application locally:

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **Python 3.9+** installed. Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install flask joblib numpy pandas scikit-learn==1.6.1 shap flask-cors pefile xgboost rarfile
```

### 2️⃣ Configure the Project Path

Open `server.py` and update the `BASE_PATH` variable to the absolute path where you placed this project folder.

For example:

```python
BASE_PATH = "C:/Users/YourName/Projects/Website"
```

### 3️⃣ Start the Server

Run the application with:

```bash
python server.py
```
